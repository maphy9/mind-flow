# 🌿 MindFlow

A mobile app supporting the mental health of urban residents

## 🧠 Project Overview

MindFlow is a mobile application designed to reduce stress and overstimulation among young adults by combining artificial intelligence, relaxation maps, and personalized recommendations.
Our goal is to create healthier, more balanced cities — where technology supports people instead of overwhelming them.

## 🤖 MindBot – Your Personal Well-Being Assistant

At the heart of the app is MindBot (Agentic AI) – an intelligent companion that:

Analyzes your mood and daily context,

Initiates actions on its own, suggesting activities such as a walk, meditation, stretching, or a short offline break,

Helps you build healthy habits and maintain emotional balance.

Using AI-driven recommendations, the app learns your preferences and develops a plan for improving your well-being.
